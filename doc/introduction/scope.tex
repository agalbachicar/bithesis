\subsection{Scope}
\label{sec:intro_scope}

This thesis aims to thoroughly describe a financial machine learning pipeline for strategy training and validation. It will be exercised over bitcoin price with a fundamental momentum strategy. Multiple source features will be examined and used: financial, bitcoin and Bitcoin features, social media and structural break features. Feature engineering for time series will be applied and discussed in favor of determining the implications of sample uniqueness and series stationarity. Ensemble tree models will be used, trained and verified via cross validation with sample adjustments in favor of reduced leakage. Strategy and hyperparameter optimization, and feature selection will be conducted prior to back testing. The final stage will assign bet sizes and run back tests with budget metrics to quantitatively determine whether staking, momentum alone or this full strategy is the best one. Figure \ref{fig:pipeline}, which is in section \ref{sec:methods_pipeline}, shows the aforementioned pipeline.
