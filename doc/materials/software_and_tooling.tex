\label{sec:material_software_and_tooling}

This research project makes extensive use of open source software tools. To name a few:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Python: programming language with extensive adoption in the data science community as well as \emph{R}.
    \item numpy: one of the main Math libraries available in Python. It has extensive support for arrays and matrices.
    \item scikit-learn: provides support for most of the machine learning models and tooling.
    \item pandas: library for data management in Python.
    \item statsmodels: provides support for statistical models and hypothesis tests in Python.
